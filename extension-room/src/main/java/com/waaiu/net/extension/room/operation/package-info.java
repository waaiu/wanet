/**
 * Provides gameplay-operation extension points and handlers for room-based
 * games, including
 * strategy/flyweight style operation dispatch.
 * <p>
 * Gameplay Operation Business - Design Patterns: Strategy Pattern + Flyweight
 * Pattern
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Strategy Pattern:
 * Define an interface and write two implementation classes that implement this interface,
 * allowing the use of one interface and then selecting the appropriate implementation class as needed.
 * Flyweight Pattern:
 * Maintains instances of the gameplay interface implementation class {@link com.waaiu.net.extension.room.operation.OperationHandler}.
 *
 * Centralizes the management of the state of many "virtual" objects, reducing the number of runtime
 * object instances and saving memory.
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Usage Example - Configuring Gameplay Operations
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Create OperationFactory object (framework's built-in implementation)
 * OperationFactory factory = OperationFactory.of();
 *
 * // Configure gameplay operation
 * factory.mappingUser(1, new ShootOperationHandler());
 *
 * // If there are more operations, they can be configured continuously.
 * // Here we use pseudocode for a Mahjong example, configuring Chi, Peng, and
 * // Gang operations.
 * factory.mappingUser(10, new ChiOperationHandler());
 * factory.mappingUser(11, new PengOperationHandler());
 * factory.mappingUser(12, new GangOperationHandler());
 * }</pre>
