/**
 * Provides the core abstractions and runtime infrastructure for external servers, including
 * protocol handling, session management, hooks, and internal communication integration.
 *
 * <p>See <a href="https://waaiu.github.io/ionet/docs/manual/external_intro">External Server</a> for
 * the architecture overview.
 * <p>
 * Responsibilities of the External Server
 * <pre>
 * 1. Maintain long connections with users (players)
 * 2. Help developers abstract away communication and connection details
 * 3. Supported connection methods: WebSocket, TCP, UDP
 * 4. Forward user (player) requests to the Gateway
 * 5. Dynamic scaling (adding or removing) of server instances
 * 6. Feature extensions, such as: route existence detection, route permissions, UserSession management, heartbeats,
 * and future features like circuit breakers, rate limiting, load shedding (or graceful degradation), and user traffic statistics.
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Extension Scenario
 * <pre>
 * The External Server is primarily responsible for connections with users (players).
 * Suppose a single piece of hardware supports a maximum of 5000 user connections.
 * When the number of users reaches 7000, we can add another External Server to manage traffic and reduce load.
 *
 * Due to the scalability and flexibility of the External Server, it can support concurrent online players ranging
 * from a few thousand to tens of millions.
 * This is because by increasing the number of External Servers, connection load balancing and traffic control
 * can be effectively managed, enabling the system to better withstand high concurrency pressure.
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Switching, Support, and Extension of Connection Methods
 * <pre>
 * The External Server already provides support for TCP, WebSocket, and UDP connection methods, and offers flexible ways
 * to switch between them.
 * TCP, WebSocket, and UDP connection methods can be seamlessly integrated with the business code.
 * Developers can use a single set of business code, without any modification, to simultaneously support multiple communication protocols.
 *
 * If you want to switch to a different connection method, you only need to change the corresponding enumeration, which is very simple.
 * Furthermore, in addition to easily switching various connection methods, it can simultaneously support and allow multiple
 * connection methods to coexist within the same application.
 *
 * Connection methods are extensible, and extension is also simple. This means that if KCP support is added later,
 * switching the connection method of existing projects, such as TCP, WebSocket, or UDP, to KCP will also be simple.
 * </pre>
