/**
 * Provides route-level external-server caching support for serving hot data
 * directly from the
 * external layer and reducing logic-server round trips.
 *
 * <p>
 * See <a href="https://waaiu.github.io/wanet/docs/manual/cache">Cache</a> for
 * setup and usage.
 * <p>
 * When caching business data, the general practice is to use professional
 * caching libraries such as Caffeine, cache2k, ehcache, JetCache, etc., to
 * cache business data in the logic server.
 * <p>
 * However, the External Server Cache can store some hot business data in the
 * external server's memory. When a player accesses the relevant route, the data
 * will be fetched directly from the external server's memory. This avoids
 * repeated requests to the logic server, achieving a super performance boost.
 * <p>
 * When we combine the external server cache with professional caching
 * libraries, we can achieve even greater performance results. Because we can
 * cache hot data in the external server, subsequent players accessing that hot
 * data will not need to retrieve it from the logic server; they can get the
 * data directly from the external server layer.
 * <p>
 * The usage of the external server cache is similar to route access control. If
 * you are already familiar with that part, you can get started in a few
 * minutes.
 * <p>
 * The external server cache offers a huge performance improvement, mainly in
 * several aspects:
 * 1. When players access cached data, the response is faster because the
 * request chain is shorter.
 * 2. Data is fetched directly from the external server, without the need to
 * pass the request to the logic server, and without the need for serialization
 * of business data.
 * 3. Avoids passing requests to the logic server, saving system resources.
 * <p>
 * Features:
 * 1. Zero learning curve.
 * 2. Can quickly respond to player requests.
 * 3. Simplifies cache usage; even if these business data are not cached in the
 * logic server, configuring the relevant route cache in the external server can
 * achieve the caching effect.
 * 4. Reduces request transmission. The external server cache also reduces
 * request transmission, allowing business data to be processed at the external
 * server without going through the logic server.
 * 5. Avoids serialization. Since the business data corresponding to the route
 * is cached as a byte[] type in the external server, the business data obtained
 * from the cache will no longer require serialization (encoding). In simple
 * terms, there's no need to convert the business object into a byte[] type.
 * 6. Supports conditional caching; the same action can support different
 * request parameters.
 * 7. Supports route range cache configuration.
