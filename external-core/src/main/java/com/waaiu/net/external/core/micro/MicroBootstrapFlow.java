/**
 * The startup process for a server that connects with real players.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Developers can use this interface to orchestrate the server, with orchestration divided into two phases: build time and new connection time.
 *
 * You can also selectively override the process methods to customize the business logic for your own projects.
 * The framework provides implementations for TCP, WebSocket, and UDP.
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The execution order of the interface methods is:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 1. The execution flow for [Build Time], where createFlow calls the option and channelInitializer methods.
 * 1.1 option
 * 1.2 channelInitializer
 *
 * 2. The execution flow for [New Connection Time], where pipelineFlow calls pipelineCodec, pipelineIdle, and pipelineCustom.
 * 2.1 pipelineCodec
 * 2.2 pipelineIdle
 * 2.3 pipelineCustom
 * </pre>
