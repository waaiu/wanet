/**
 * Executor region, managing implementations of {@link ThreadExecutorRegion}
 * (Thread Executor Region).
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Manages {@link UserThreadExecutorRegion}, {@link UserVirtualThreadExecutorRegion}, and {@link SimpleThreadExecutorRegion}.
 * Even if multiple logical servers are started in the same process, thread-related resources will be shared
 * to avoid creating too many threads.
 *
 * {@link UserThreadExecutorRegion} - User Thread Executor Region
 * This executor is mainly used to consume action-related business logic, or user-related business logic.
 * The corresponding ThreadExecutor is obtained through userId to execute the business logic, thereby avoiding concurrency issues.
 *
 * {@link UserVirtualThreadExecutorRegion} - User Virtual Thread Executor Region
 * This executor is mainly used to consume IO-related business logic (such as DB persistence).
 *
 * {@link SimpleThreadExecutorRegion} - Simple Thread Executor Region
 * This executor is similar to {@link UserThreadExecutorRegion}.
 * The corresponding ThreadExecutor can be obtained through an index to execute the business logic, thereby avoiding concurrency issues.
 * This executor can be used if the business logic is compute-intensive and you don't want to occupy the thread resources of {@link UserThreadExecutorRegion}.
 * </pre>
