/**
 * Task listener callback, used in scenarios such as: one-time delayed tasks,
 * scheduled tasks, lightweight controllable delayed tasks, lightweight periodic
 * persistence helper functions, and other extended scenarios.
 * <a href="https://waaiu.github.io/wanet/docs/kit/task_kit">Documentation</a>
 *
 * <pre>
 * These usage scenarios share a common feature: listener callbacks. The interface provides 4 methods, as follows:
 * 1. {@link TaskListener#onUpdate()}, listener callback
 * 2. {@link TaskListener#triggerUpdate()}, whether to trigger the {@link TaskListener#onUpdate()} listener callback method
 * 3. {@link TaskListener#onException(Throwable)} , exception callback. If an exception is thrown during the execution of {@link TaskListener#triggerUpdate()} and {@link TaskListener#onUpdate()} methods, it will be caught by this method.
 * 4. {@link TaskListener#getExecutor()}, specify the executor to run the above methods, with the goal of not occupying business threads.
 * </pre>
