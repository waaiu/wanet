/**
 * Subscriber annotation, marks a method as an event subscriber (receives events, processes events),

 * <pre>
 * The subscriber must have one and only one parameter, used to receive the event source.
 * It is thread-safe by default, using the user thread executor.
 * </pre>
 * for example
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class YourEventBusSubscriber implements EventBusSubscriber {
 *     // Specify the thread executor to execute the subscriber's logic
 *     @EventSubscribe(ExecutorSelector.userExecutor)
 *     public void userLogin(YourEventMessage message) {
