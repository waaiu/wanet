/**
 * Provides domain-event infrastructure based on Disruptor for implementing
 * asynchronous event-driven
 * workflows, similar in spirit to Guava EventBus or Spring `ApplicationEvent`.
 *
 * <p>
 * See <a href=
 * "https://waaiu.github.io/wanet/docs/extension_module/domain_event">domain-event</a>
 * for module usage and integration guidance.
 * Disruptor is an open-source concurrent framework. It is a high-performance
 * queue developed by the British foreign exchange trading company LMAX, which
 * greatly simplifies the difficulty of concurrent program development and won
 * the 2011 Duke’s Program Framework Innovation Award. Disruptor can be
 * understood as a single-machine version of MQ (the lightest and fastest
 * single-machine MQ -- disruptor).
 * <p>
 * Advantages of Event Source Domain Events
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 1. Domain-Driven Design, based on LMAX architecture.
 * 2. Single Responsibility Principle, which can achieve the ultimate in system extensibility, high scalability, and low coupling.
 * 3. Asynchronous high concurrency and thread-safe, using disruptor ring buffer to consume business.
 * 4. Writing code using event consumption methods, even if the business is complex, the code will not become messy, and the cost of code maintenance is lower.
 * 5. Flexible customization of business thread models
 * 6. Event domain provided in plugin form, achieving plug-and-play, as interesting as playing Lego bricks.
